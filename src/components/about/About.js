                <Info>I'm a perfectionist who likes to keep things organized. Learning, developing and challenging myself is fun and interesting.
                I like to see where I can push myself to learn even more. I find it rewarding to help, work and understand other people.
                And likewise with programming. At first you might not understand or know a person or code that well, but if you open up and spend some
                    time to get to know them, eventually you'll get a deeper insight and understanding on how to solve problems with or for that person.</Info>


                <Info>I know I have much more to learn as a front-end developer. But I see how much I've learned the last two years at Noroff, and I believe that my work
                experience combined with my bachelors in marketing will help me understand the customer better. I have the passion, curiostiy and
                    willingness to learn.</Info>
