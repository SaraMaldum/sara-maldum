                        <Info>I'm a 28 year old front-end development student, graduating October 2020. I'm based in Jessheim, Norway.</Info>
                        <Info>My previous work experience are mainly sales and customer service, which I liked, as I got to work with people.
                        I like to understand other peoples perspectives, see their needs and help them achieve those thoughts and goals.
                        These are qualities I always want to evolve and make use of as I'm turning into a great front-end developer.
                        I have a passion to create and solve problems, and therefore I know I'll be a good developer.
                        I am currently in training and loving it!</Info>
